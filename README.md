Tic Tac Toe Game

This Tic Tac Toe game is a simple yet engaging web-based implementation built using JavaScript, Bootstrap, and HTML. It offers a classic gaming experience where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to achieve a line of three consecutive marks - either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally - before your opponent does.
